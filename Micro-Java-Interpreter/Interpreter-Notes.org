			  Interpreter Notes

* TODO Check out outline resources for writing a Java interpreter (maybe EOPL will have some guidance here or some other recommended book)
* What I need to implement for the interpreter
** Cell
** Environment: <identifier, cell>
** Closure (for methods) (along with the `this` variable)
** Mutually recursive methods? => Recursive environment (maybe subclasses Environment)
** Class class (with vtable)
* Plan of action
** Build an environment class
** Interpret trivial stuff using the environment
*** variable reference, etc
*** allocation of different kinds
*** different expressions (primary or otherwise)
*** different statements
** Closure
** Methods
** Mutually recursive methods
** Class class
** Class declaration
** Inheritance
