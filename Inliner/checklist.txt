Checklist for Assignment 6

1) Have you tarred + gripped the file as XXXXXXXX.tar.gz (your 8-digit roll number) ? Yes

2) Does your tar.gz file expand (by using the command tar xvzf) to the base directory named XXXXXXXX (your 8-digit roll number) ? Yes

3) Have you removed all the class files and jar files from your tar ball? Yes

4) Does your base folder contains P6.java, as the &quot;main&quot; file, that can be compiled using javac? Yes

5) Does your P6.java take input from Standard Input (for usage of redirection) ? Yes

6) Does your P6.java write output to Standard Output (for usage of redirection) ? Yes

7) Have you removed all the debugging messages that your program may output? Yes

8) Is (some part of) the assignment plagiarized? No

9) Any comments about your evaluation strategy :

+ I am not inlining recursive calls

+ For the case foo.bar = expression, I am using the conservative
  technique where I add a ConditionalConstraint,
  ClassC \in [foo] => [expression] \sub [bar]

  where ClassC is a class that has the class variable "bar".
  This way, we take care of polymorphism for foo.
